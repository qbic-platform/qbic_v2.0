QBIC Coin

By the people, for the people.

Qbic is an open source digital currency that enables anonymous, instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world using the Zerocoin protocol, with low transaction fees & environmental footprint. . Qbic uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Qbic Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

QBIC utilizes the first ever anonymous proof of stake protocol, called zPoS, combined with regular PoS and masternodes for securing its network. zPoS incentivises using the privacy features available in QBIC by granting a higher block reward for zPoS over regular PoS and masternodes. In practice QBIC has between 4 to 10 times higher use of it's privacy features in comparison to other coins that combine public and private transactions. This is thanks to innovations like zPoS and integrating the Zerocoin protocol into light/mobile wallets, allowing for a complete and lightweight privacy protocol that can be used on the go. As well as security improvements like deterministic generation of zPIV for easy backups. The goal of QBIC is to achieve a decentralized sustainable crypto currency with near instant full-time private transactions, fair governance and community intelligence.
